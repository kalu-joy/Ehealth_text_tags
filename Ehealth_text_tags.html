        <strong>Nobody’s</strong> born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t <em>talk</em>, can’t <em>walk</em>, certainly
        can’t do <em>algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing.</em> Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a <em>little bit stronger.</em><br>
        <strong><em>Failing</em></strong> is just another word for <strong><em>growing.</em></strong> And you keep
        going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole <em>universe</em><br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere</em> can understand.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
